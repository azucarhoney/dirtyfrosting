 <h2>Sweet Origins</h2>
<p>
  Dirty Frosting began as a quiet escape during the uncertainty of 2020. While the world slowed down, I found comfort in the kitchen — baking, testing, and perfecting recipes from scratch. What started as a personal ritual quickly grew into a passion for creating beautiful, indulgent treats that felt like little moments of magic.
</p>
<p>
  I began sharing my bakes on Instagram and TikTok, and to my surprise, others connected with the joy and warmth behind them. That’s when the dream really began: to one day open a bakery called Dirty Frosting — a place where beauty, flavor, and a hint of mischief live in perfect harmony.
</p>

  <h2>What We Believe</h2>
<p>
  Dirty Frosting isn’t about perfection — it’s about play. It’s the joy of getting your hands messy, of making something beautiful and delicious without needing it to be flawless.
</p>
<p>
  We believe in bold palettes, chaotic counters, late-night baking experiments, and chasing what delights you. But behind the sprinkles and spontaneity is a deep love for craft — a commitment to getting it right, even when it’s messy along the way. Dirty Frosting is where creativity meets care, and where joy is always part of the recipe.
</p>

    <h2>The Name?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s a little cheeky, we know. But behind the naughty name is something unexpected. The name "Dirty Frosting" started in a high school culinary arts class. During a lesson on crumb coating, our teacher accidentally called it "dirty frosting" instead of "dirty icing" — and the phrase stuck with me. It was funny at first, but over time, it started to feel oddly fitting: a little messy, a little sweet, and entirely unforgettable.
