        <img src="images/our-story-image.jpg" alt="Baking ingredients on a counter">
        <p>Baking has always been more than just mixing flour, sugar, and butter—it’s a way to create warmth, joy, and connection.</p>
            My love for baking started in my high school cooking class.</p>
            This class inspired me to get in my family kitchen, where I spent countless hours perfecting recipes, experimenting with flavors, and sharing sweet treats with family and friends.</p>
            What began as a simple passion quickly turned into a dream: to one day open my own bakery, a place where every bite feels like home.</p>
            Dirty Frosting is my way of bringing that dream to life, one recipe at a time. This space is filled with my favorite homemade creations, from comforting classics to delightful new twists.</p> 
            Every recipe is made with care, love, and the hope of inspiring others to find joy in baking.</p> 
            One day, I hope to welcome you into my own bakery—a cozy spot filled with the aroma of freshly baked goods, a place where every cake, cookie, and pastry tells a story.</p> 
            Until then, I invite you to explore my recipes, bake along with me, and share in this journey. After all, the sweetest dreams begin with a dirty kitchen and a little bit of frosting.</p>
